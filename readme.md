# Haskell learning notes
This repo contains my notes and code, that I take along the way to grasp basics of Haskell.

# Goal
My goal here is not to master the language and become extra profound in it. I rather aim on learning some basics and get some alternative approach which can be used to solve problems, other than OOP and imperative. 

# Resources
These are the resources that I use to follow well structured and informed path.
